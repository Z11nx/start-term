# Commands

Start-term is similar to vim in that you can change modes in the terminal

## Command mode
Pressing c will put you in command mode. Here you can change the settings and theming of the terminal, as well as add and remove website links
* bg x - Change the background wallpaper to the image specified
* front-img x - change the windowed image to the image specified
* v on - turns on vignette
* v off - turns off vignette
* se x - changes search engine (Brave, Google, DuckDuckGo)

## Search mode
Pressing s will put you in search mode, which allows you to search the internet based off your input in the terminal bar

## Link mode
Allows you to directly enter websites based off the links you have added in the settings
* For example, once you have added a link in command mode, you can then just type in the abbreviated name you gave it, and you will directly be launched to the website of choice in a new tab
